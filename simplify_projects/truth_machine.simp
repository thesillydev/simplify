a?s()\i|a="0":\ p("0")\ b\e:\ w|T:\  p("1")

Ok it seems complicated but not really tho
this character mess is the result of shorting everything into one line
I will make it look clearer
    | is the space, i used it because the space char already corresponds to the tab char
    \ is the newline char
Pretty simple, right?
